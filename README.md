# Cloud API Resume.

This project is a version of the popular Cloud Resume Challenge, but with an exciting twist. Here are some differences:
- Instead of manually deploying resources on the AWS Management Console, we will use Infrastructure as Code(IaC). Click [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/devops/deliver/what-is-infrastructure-as-code) to learn more about IaC.
- We shall use different services. We will use a Lambda function and API Gateway to deliver your resume as a JSON document.

This project is beginner friendly, and will help you gain hands-on skills in the AWS Cloud Platform. 

## Prerequisites
